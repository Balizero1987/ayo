## Common Mistakes and Critical Warnings

### 1. KBLI Selection Errors

**Mistake:** Choosing wrong or overly broad KBLI code
**Impact:** License rejection, operational restrictions, compliance issues
**Solution:**
- Always choose the MOST SPECIFIC KBLI code for your main activity
- Use 70209 (Other Management Consulting) only if no specific code exists
- Consult with Indonesian business consultant before finalizing KBLI selection
- Remember: You can have multiple KBLI codes, but each requires separate investment minimum

### 2. Legal Services Restrictions

**CRITICAL WARNING:** Foreign lawyers and law firms CANNOT:
- Practice Indonesian law in any capacity
- Represent clients in Indonesian courts
- Establish independent law firms
- Partner as equity holders in Indonesian law firms

**What IS allowed:**
- Employment as legal consultant on foreign/international law
- Maximum 5 foreign lawyers per Indonesian firm
- Maximum 20% foreign lawyers in firm staff
- Advisory only (not advocacy/litigation)

**Consequence of violation:** Criminal penalties, deportation, firm closure

### 3. Professional Licensing Gaps

**Mistake:** Starting operations before obtaining mandatory professional licenses

**Sectors Affected:**
- **Accounting/Auditing:** IAPI membership and MoF registration required BEFORE providing public accounting services
- **Tax Consulting:** Practice license (Brevet A/B/C + USKP) mandatory BEFORE serving clients
- **Architecture/Engineering:** SKA and SBU required BEFORE taking consulting projects
- **Laboratory Testing:** ISO 17025 accreditation required BEFORE issuing test reports
- **Certification:** KAN accreditation required BEFORE issuing certificates

**Consequence:** Services rendered are legally invalid, fines, business closure, professional sanctions

### 4. Capital Underestimation

**Mistake:** Depositing minimum capital but insufficient operational funds

**Reality Check:**
- IDR 10 billion minimum is INVESTMENT plan, not just paid-up capital
- Paid-up capital can be used for operations, BUT:
  - Office setup: IDR 50-500 million
  - Equipment/systems: IDR 50-500 million
  - Professional certifications: IDR 20-100 million
  - First 6 months operations: IDR 500 million - 2 billion
  - Working capital reserve: IDR 500 million - 2 billion

**Recommendation:** Budget IDR 15-20 billion total for first year (USD 950,000-1,270,000)

### 5. Timeline Miscalculation

**Mistake:** Expecting to operate within 1-2 months

**Realistic Timelines:**
- **Simple consulting (70209, no certification required):** 2-3 months
- **Accounting/Tax (IAPI/Brevet required):** 3-6 months
- **Architecture/Engineering (SKA/SBU required):** 4-6 months
- **Laboratory (ISO 17025 accreditation):** 8-15 months
- **Certification body (KAN accreditation):** 6-12 months

**Critical path items:**
- Professional certifications (cannot be rushed)
- Accreditation processes (fixed assessment schedules)
- Personnel recruitment and training

### 6. Expatriate Work Authorization

**Mistake:** Starting work on tourist/business visa, planning to "regularize later"

**Consequences:**
- Deportation and blacklist (5-10 years)
- Company fined
- Work performed may be considered invalid

**Proper Process:**
1. Establish PT PMA
2. Obtain IMTA (Foreign Worker Placement Plan) approval
3. Apply for ITAS (limited stay permit) and work permit
4. Complete in-country immigration procedures
5. THEN start work

**Timeline for work permit:** 2-4 months
**Cost per expatriate:** IDR 15-25 million (~USD 915-1,525)

### 7. Tax Compliance Failures

**Common Mistakes:**
- Not registering for BPJS (mandatory, heavy fines)
- Late or incomplete monthly tax reporting
- Inadequate transfer pricing documentation
- Not hiring professional accountant

**Consequences:**
- Fines: 2% per month on unpaid taxes (compounding)
- BPJS fines: operational audits, business license suspension
- Tax audit risk significantly increased
- Director may be held personally liable

**Solution:** Budget IDR 10-50 million annually for professional tax/accounting services

### 8. Cultural and Market Misjudgment

**Mistake:** Applying Western business models without localization

**Examples:**
- Direct, confrontational communication style (vs. Indonesian indirect, face-saving style)
- Ignoring hierarchy and seniority in business relationships
- Underestimating importance of personal relationships (vs. contract-focused approach)
- Not understanding "jam karet" (flexible time) culture
- Inadequate patience for consensus-building decision processes

**Impact:** Lost clients, failed partnerships, staff turnover

**Solution:**
- Hire experienced Indonesian business development staff
- Invest in cultural training
- Build local partnerships and networks
- Allow 2-3x longer sales cycles than Western markets

### 9. Sector-Specific Restrictions Overlooked

**Mistake:** Assuming 100% foreign ownership for related operational activities

**Examples:**
- Transport consulting (KBLI 70202) = 100% allowed
  - BUT: Actual transport operations (shipping, aviation) = 49% maximum
- Tourism consulting (KBLI 70201) = 100% allowed
  - BUT: Tour operations may have restrictions
- Legal consulting on corporate docs (KBLI 69102) = allowed with restrictions
  - BUT: Legal practice/litigation (KBLI 69101) = CLOSED

**Solution:** Verify Perpres 10/2021 annexes for EACH KBLI code, especially if planning integrated services

### 10. Intellectual Property Protection Gaps

**Mistake:** Not securing IP before research publication or product launch

**Issues:**
- Indonesia is "first to file" jurisdiction for patents
- IP enforcement relatively weak compared to developed countries
- Technology transfer regulations may require disclosure
- Genetic resources subject to Nagoya Protocol (benefit-sharing)

**Solution:**
- File patents/trademarks BEFORE public disclosure
- Use NDAs extensively
- Register copyrights for software and creative works
- Understand compulsory licensing provisions
