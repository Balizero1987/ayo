# Indonesia Announces New E-Visa System for Business Travelers

The Indonesian government has introduced a streamlined electronic visa (e-visa) system designed to facilitate business travel and boost foreign investment. The new system, which went into effect this month, allows eligible business travelers from 95 countries to apply for visas entirely online.

## Key Features of the New E-Visa System

The modernized e-visa platform offers several advantages over the traditional visa application process:

**1. Faster Processing Times**: Applications are now processed within 3-5 business days, compared to the previous 10-14 day waiting period. Urgent applications can be expedited for an additional fee.

**2. Enhanced Document Security**: The system incorporates blockchain technology to verify documents and prevent fraud, ensuring greater security for both applicants and immigration authorities.

**3. Multiple Entry Options**: Business travelers can choose between single-entry, multiple-entry (30 days), or extended stay visas (up to 60 days), depending on their business needs.

**4. Mobile-Friendly Interface**: The application can be completed entirely on mobile devices, with automatic document scanning and validation features.

## Eligibility Requirements

To qualify for the new e-visa system, applicants must:

- Hold a valid passport with at least 6 months validity
- Provide proof of business activities in Indonesia (invitation letter, company registration, etc.)
- Show evidence of sufficient funds for the duration of stay
- Have return flight tickets or onward travel arrangements
- Provide proof of accommodation in Indonesia

## Application Process

The application process has been simplified to four main steps:

1. **Online Registration**: Create an account on the official immigration portal
2. **Document Upload**: Submit required documents (passport copy, photo, business proof)
3. **Payment**: Pay visa fee online via credit card or bank transfer
4. **Approval**: Receive e-visa via email within 3-5 days

## Impact on Foreign Investment

Immigration officials expect the new system to significantly boost business tourism and foreign direct investment. "By removing bureaucratic hurdles, we're making Indonesia more attractive to international businesses," stated the Director General of Immigration.

The chamber of commerce estimates this could lead to a 25% increase in business visitor arrivals in the first year of implementation.

## Important Notes for Applicants

- The e-visa is currently only available for business purposes; tourist visas still require separate application
- Overstaying the visa will result in fines of IDR 1,000,000 per day
- Visa extensions must be applied for at least 7 days before expiration
- Working without proper work permits remains strictly prohibited
