# B1 Visa Conversation — English Version

**Client:**  
Hi, I’d like to understand more about the B1 Visa. What exactly is it used for?

**Consultant:**  
The B1 Visa is a visit visa intended for **business meetings, market research, negotiations, or any non-working activities** in Indonesia. You may come for business-related purposes, but **you cannot work or receive any income** in the country.

**Client:**  
So if I want to research investment opportunities or check locations, I can use the B1 Visa?

**Consultant:**  
Absolutely. The B1 Visa is ideal for surveys, checking properties, meeting notaries, or preparing future business plans.

**Client:**  
What if I need to present an idea or meet potential partners?

**Consultant:**  
That’s allowed, as long as it's **not tied to employment** and you **don’t receive any payment**. Presentations, meetings, seminars—those are fine.

**Client:**  
How long can I stay with this visa?

**Consultant:**  
The B1 Visa gives you **60 days** of stay. It’s a **single-entry visa**, meaning once you leave Indonesia, the visa becomes invalid.
